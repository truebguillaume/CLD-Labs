### Task 5: Install a web server and configure a web site

In this task you will configure the managed host to run an NGINX web
server. This will necessitate four files:

* The inventory file from the previous task _(ansible/hosts)_.
* A playbook with instructions what to configure _(ansible/playbooks/web.yml)_.
* The configuration file for NGINX _(ansible/playbooks/files/nginx.conf)_.
* A template for the home page of our web site _(ansible/playbooks/templates/index.html.j2)_.

To make our playbook more generic, we will refer to our managed server
not by its individual name, but we will create a group called
_webservers_ and put our server into it. We can then later easily add
more servers which Ansible will configure identically.

Modify the file _ansible/hosts_ by adding a definition of the group
_webservers_, which for the time being contains exactly one server,
_gce_instance_:

    [webservers]
    gce_instance ansible_ssh_host=<your ip>

You should now be able to ping the webservers group:

```
ansible webservers -m ping
```

[OUTPUT]
```json
gce_instance | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

The output should be the same as before.

Now get the [web.yml](./appendices/ansible/web.yml) playbook file and put it in the _ansible/playbooks_ directory.

The playbook references the configuration file for NGINX. Get the [nginx.conf](./appendices/ansible/nginx.conf) file and put it in the _ansible/playbooks/files_ directory.

The configuration file tells NGINX to serve the homepage from
_index.html_. We'll use Ansible's template functionality so that
Ansible will generate the file from a template.

Get the [index.html.j2](./appendices/ansible/index.html.j2) template file and put it in the _ansible/playbooks/templates_ directory.

You should have a file structure like this

    .
    ├── ansible
    │   ├── ansible.cfg
    │   ├── hosts
    │   └── playbooks
    │       ├── files
    │       │   └── nginx.conf
    │       ├── templates
    │       │   └── index.html.j2
    │       └── web.yml
    ├── credentials
    │   ├── labgce-service-account-key.json
    │   ├── labgce-ssh-key
    │   └── labgce-ssh-key.pub
    └── terraform
        ├── backend.tf
        ├── main.tf
        ├── outputs.tf
        ├── terraform.tfstate
        ├── terraform.tfstate.backup
        ├── terraform.tfvars
        └── variables.tf

Now you can run the newly created playbook to configure NGINX on the
managed host. The command to run playbooks is `ansible-playbook` and must be ran from the `ansible` directory:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbooks/web.yml
```

This should produce output similar to the following:

```bash
PLAY [Configure webservers with nginx] ******************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [gce_instance]

TASK [Install nginx] ***********************************************************
changed: [gce_instance]

TASK [Copy nginx config file] **************************************************
changed: [gce_instance]

TASK [Enable configuration] ****************************************************
ok: [gce_instance]

TASK [Copy index.html] *********************************************************
changed: [gce_instance]

TASK [Restart nginx] ***********************************************************
changed: [gce_instance]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
gce_instance                 : ok=6    changed=4    unreachable=0    failed=0
```

You can then test the new web site by pointing your browser to the
address of the managed server. You should see the homepage showing
"NGINX, configured by Ansible".

//TODO
[INPUT]
```bash
curl 34.65.241.126
```

[OUTPUT]
```html
<html>
    <head>
    <title>Welcome to ansible</title> </head>
    <body>
    <h1>nginx, configured by Ansible</h1>
    <p>If you can see this, Ansible successfully installed nginx.</p>
    <p>Ansible managed</p>
    <p>Some facts Ansible gathered about this machine:
    <table>
        <tr><td>OS family:</td><td>Debian</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Distribution:</td><td>Ubuntu</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Distribution version:</td><td>20.04</td></tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    </body>
</html>%
```
